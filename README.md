# REACT-mongoDB-express--login-page
This project involves building a login page using React for the client-side, and MongoDB with Express for the server-side. The client communicates with the server to authenticate users. When a user submits login credentials, the React app sends a request to the Express server, which checks the credentials against a MongoDB database.
