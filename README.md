This project is a full-stack login system using React, MongoDB, and Express, where the front-end (client) and back-end (server) work together to handle user authentication.

Client (React):
React is used to build the user interface. The login page allows users to input their username and password.
Upon form submission, the login details are sent to the back-end server via an HTTP POST request (using fetch or axios).
State management is handled within React (using hooks like useState and useEffect).
If the login is successful, the server returns a JWT (JSON Web Token) or a session token, which can be stored in the client (usually in localStorage or sessionStorage).
The client can use this token to authorize further requests (for example, to access protected routes in the application).

Server (Express.js):
The server is built using Express.js, which serves as the API layer for handling authentication requests.
When the client sends a login request, the server receives the credentials and verifies them against stored records in the MongoDB database.
MongoDB stores user data, including hashed passwords (using bcrypt or a similar library for security).
The server checks if the user exists and if the provided password matches the hashed password stored in the database.
Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT (or session cookie) and sends it back to the client, which can use it for subsequent authenticated requests.
The server also includes error handling for cases like incorrect credentials, user not found, and system errors.
